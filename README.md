# PeriodicTable
## Periodic Table Program
# A project I made during my first semester at DIT HUA (2024)

### Description:
A C-based program that allows users to search for individual elements or groups of elements in the periodic table. It is ideal for educational purposes due to its simplicity and user-friendly interface. Users can easily explore the elements of the periodic table, learning details such as atomic number, symbol, atomic mass, and name.

### Features:
- Search individual elements for detailed information.
- Search by group, with highlighted groups in the periodic table.
